<p>At the top left-hand side of Performance frames are three buttons for accessing various<br>
sub panels. These buttons are <em>MIDI</em>, <em>CTRL</em>, and <em>Edit</em>.</p>

<p>The MIDI tab is selected in the image below and is identical to the 
<a href="properties.html">Channel MIDI tab.</a><br>

The only difference is that now the properties shown are at the Performance level.</p>

<p>The <a href="#ctrl">CTRL</a> tab is for editing MIDI continuous controller properties. The content of this tab is<br>
similar to the MIDI tab. For each controller the instrument responds to there are corresponding <br>
curve, scale, bias and inherit widgets.</p>

<p>The <a href="#editor">Edit</a> tab is for editing instrument programs or "patches". The exact content of this tab is <br>
determined by the specific instrument.

    </div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Program banks hold 128 programs numbered between 0 and 127 and are always visible on the left side
of performance frames.</p>

<p>At the bottom of Performance frames are where bank related controls are found. The numeric display, <br>
cluster of arrow buttons, and "store" button are for saving the current patch into the bank. <br>
The number displays the bank slot where the program is to be saved. This value is automatically changed <br>
whenever a new program is selected (either manually or by MIDI program change). The four arrow buttons are <br>
for selecting the store location. The single arrows increment or decrement the slot number by 1. The double <br>
arrows change the slot number by 8. Click the "store" button to save the current program into the selected slot.</p>

<p>Immediately to the right of the "store" button is a large area to display current program name.<br>
The name is truncated if it is too large and is always converted to upper case. Program names are mixed<br>
case so this display may not exactly match the actual program name.</p>

<p>Whenever the current program data has been altered, the word '<strong>modified</strong>' appears above the program name.<br>
Once the program has been saved the word modified disappears. The code responsible for displaying modified runs on a <br>
low-priority thread and it may not appear/disappear immediately</p>

<p>The buttons to the right of the program name are for bank initialization, Open and Save bank data, and undo/redo of <br>
bank changes. The undo/redo feature is for changes to the bank only and not for individual program changes.</p>

<p>Program banks are saved as text files (Clojure code) and have filenames:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>name.xxx_bank</em> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; where 'xxx' is the Cadejo <br>
instrument's name.</p>   </div>

      <h2 class="section_head">Progressive Program Mode</h2>
    </div>
<p>Progressive Program Mode allows multiple programs to be used simultaneously.<br>
Progressive mode is active whenever the progressive mode display shows a number greater then 1.<br>
Use the up and down arrow buttons to change the progressive mode count.</p>

<p>When a program change is received and the progressive mode count is greater then 1, each voice<br>
receives a different program from the program bank. This is easier to describe by example.</p>

<p>Assume the progressive value is 2 and there are 8 polyphonic voices (the default). <br>
In this situation whenever a MIDI program change occurs for program n, the first voice <br>
receives program n, the second voice receives program n+1, the third voice receives program n <br>
the fourth voice program n+1. This alternation between program n and n+1 continues for all 8 voices. <br>
If the progressive count is 3 the voices revives programs n, n+1 and n+2 in a cycle etcetera.</p>

<p><strong>Progressive Mode Caveats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Progressive mode works best with rotate keymode, and not at all with mono keymodes. See <a href="channel.html#keymodes"> keymodes</a></li>
<li>Program editing is disabled when progressive mode is active. Which program would we be editing?</li>
<li>Currently (24-Sep-15) progressive mode is only activated by external MIDI program change. <br>
    Clicking an entry in the program bank list does not work with progressive mode. Hopefully this will be fixed soon.</li>
</ul><p class="footnote">Historical Perspective:</p>
<p class="footnote">Oberheim released the "Synthesizer Expander Module" or SEM in 1974. The SEM was a small self-contained monophonic synthesizer<br>
packaged as a module and without keyboard. By 1975 they started strapping 2, 4 or 8 SEM modules together in a single package <br>
together with an added keyboard to produce some of the first polyphonic synthesizers.  Each voice was an analog instrument with <br>
it's own set of panel controls. With some work these separate components could be adjusted to sound nearly identical but <br>
never <em>exactly</em> identical. Each key-press had a subtly different sound. Of course the instrument could also be patched to have<br>
drastically different sounds on each key-press as well.</p>

<p>The CTRL tab is for setting MIDI continuous controller properties. It is similar in<br>
layout to the MIDI tab with an edit area for each controller. Each instrument defines <br>
exactly which controllers are available.</p>

<p>Controller values are normalized to a range between 0.0 and +1.0. The final value is <br>
given by: <br>

<p>The performance Edit tab displays the instrument editor. The editor is not created until <br>
the Edit tab is clicked. The first time the edit tab is clicked it may take several seconds<br>
to appear while it is being created. Subsequent clicks on the edit tab will be more <br> 
responsive. </p>

<p>The buttons to the left are common to all editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Init - Initialize program</li>
<li>Random - Create random program</li>
<li>Open - Open single program file. Single program filenames have the form 'xxx.iii' where iii is the instrument name.</li>
<li>Save - Write single program file</li>
<li>Copy - Copy current program to clipboard</li>
<li>Paste - Paste clipboard to current program</li>
<li>Help - Instrument specific help</li>
</ul>


<p>The buttons to the right are instrument specific. Each instrument will define it's own set of <br>
editor tabs. <em>All</em> instruments have the 'common' tab, which is where the program name is set. <br>
The image above shows the editor for the Combo organ which only has two tabs; "Common" and "Edit", <br>
with the Common tab selected.</p>

<p class="footnote">The area immediately below the program name field shows the Clojure code which defines the <br>
current program. In future releases this area may be used for some other purpose.</p>  </div>
