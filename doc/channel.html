<p>Channel nodes are an intermediate stage between incoming MIDI messages and
final instruments (performances).<br> Their primary duty is to aggregate one or
more instruments in a layer.<p>    <div class="section_image1">

        <p><strong>Output bus</strong>, Sets the SuperCollider audio bus used as the main output for this instrument.
        Defaults to 0, the first sound card.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Voice Count</strong>, Sets the number of voices for polyphonic keymodes. Default 8.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Controllers</strong>, Sets MIDI controller numbers. Each instrument type will have it's own
        set of controllers. Controllers common to most instruments are cc1 for mod wheel and cc7
        for volume. All controllers have reasonable defaults but may be freely reassigned.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Instrument ID</strong>, On any given channel each instrument must have an unique id.
        A valid id is automatically generated but may be changed if desired.</p>

<p>There are four possible keymodes:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Exclusive</li>
  <li>Mono</li>
  <li>Poly</li>
  <li>Rotate</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all keymodes are available for all instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusive</strong> is a monophonic mode where only the first keydown is articulated. As long as each<br>
note is played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staccato">staccato</a> the note will sound. For 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legato">legato</a> passages however only the first note played will sound.<br>
An instrument in exclusive mode is intended for use in a layer with some other instrument to provide an <br>
alternative sound for the first note of a legato passage. A typical example would be an organ key click.</p>

<p><strong>Mono</strong> is a generalized monophonic mode. If two or more keys are pressed only the last key down<br>
produces a note. Previous keys are not forgotten however making it possible to play monophonic trills. <br>
Mono mode is not the same as a single-voice polyphonic mode.</p>

<p><strong>Poly</strong> is a polyphonic mode which attempts to use voices in order. On the first key down voice 1 is <br>
is used. If the first key is released and pressed a 2nd time, voice 1 will again be used. If the first key is held <br>
while a 2nd key is pressed, voice 2 is used for the 2nd key, and so on. If the number of keys down exceeds the voice <br>
count then the most stale (IE the voice which has been holding the longest) is reallocated for the new note.</p>

<p><strong>Rotate</strong> is another polyphonic mode only this time voices are allocated in rotation. If the same key <br>
is repeatedly pressed and released a new voice is used for each key press.  Rotate mode uses a similar 
<br> "voice stealing" scheme as ploy mode if the voice count is exceeded.</p>

<p>The difference between Poly and Rotate modes can be subtle. Where the difference becomes apparent is when the <br>
program-bank is in <a href="performance.html#progressive_mode">progressive mode</a>.
Normally when an instrument receives a MIDI program change all voices are <br>


updated to the same "patch" and thus produce the same sound. In progressive mode each voice may have a completely <br>
different patch. Each new key press may produce a different sound. The Rotate keymode was specifically developed for <br>
this purpose.  More details on progressive program changes may found in the program bank documentation.</p>  </div>
