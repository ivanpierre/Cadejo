Xolotl BUGS

BUG X0001 2015.10.30 STATUS OPEN
When an identical note is repeated the duration of all but the first note
is truncated. These notes are played staccato regardless of the hold value.

Partial fix: Added detection of repeated notes to xolotl.pitch.clj with an
octave shift whenever the current note is the same as the previous note.
Notes above key-number are shifted down an octave. Notes below 72 are
shifted up.  This detection does not work for chords.
