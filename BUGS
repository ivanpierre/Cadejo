# ---------------------------------------------------------- BUG 0001 CLOSED
BUG 0001 2014.02.14 STATUS CLOSED
MASA does not always produce tones when used in a monophonic layer

(def s (cadejo.midi.scene/scene ...))
(def algo-0 (cadejo.instruments.algo.engine/algo-mono s 0))
(def masa-0 (cadejo.instruments.masa.engine/masa-mono s 0))

The order in which the two instruments are created appears to make a
difference. If MASA is created first it is more likely to work then if it
is created second.

Solution: This had nothing to do with MASA per se. Not too sure what the
real cause was but it appears that perhaps Overtone was requesting the SC
server to compile synths faster then it could keep up. The compilation
proceeded without any errors or warnings yet the synths were in some manner
"broken" and non-functional. The solution is to insert a short delay via
Thread/sleep after a number of synth objects are created. By trial a value
of 100 ms seams to be be adequate. The most logical location for these
delays is either inside the voice creation loop for poly-phonic instruments
or as the penultimate statement of mono-phonic instrument.

BUG 0002 2014.02.14 STATUS CLOSED
Performance using mono-keymode with transposition broken.

When a performance using mono-keymode has a non-zero :transpose property
the note-off event does not transpose the note number. As a result on a
key-up the instruments pitch abruptly shifts from the transposed to the non
transposed frequencies.

Made modification to cadejo.midi.mono-keymode

after clicking channel editor "MIDI" tab

This only appears if the lnf skin has been changed

The problem is somehow related to the interaction of disabled button icons and changes in the LNF skin.
As a temp work around certain buttons (specifically in cadejo.ui.midi.curve-panel) are not allowed to 
be disabled.

BUG 0008 2015.01.20 STATUS OPEN
NullPointerException when clicking around on a sgwr slider
Not sure of the exact conditions this error occurs, possibly it is related 
to the mouse-released event.

# ---------------------------------------------------------- BUG 0009 CLOSED
BUG 0009 2015.01.27 STATUS CLOSED
After a sgwr drawing has been flattened widgets are not being repainted 
correctly. 

A) Radio button once selected continue to display as selected even
   after they have been deselected. 

B) Multistate buttons act similar to radio buttons
   The previous state is not cleared when the state changes causing 
   the images to stack  on top of one another

C) slider tracks leave "trails"

D) Roolover color is not being cleared

2015.01.29  Possibly related to transparency. 
If drawing background is set to solid color with transparency 
the same sort of trials are observed.
Each time the drawing is re-rendered the trials become slightly
less visible until, after a few renders, they disappear.


2015.02.04 Failed attempt at resolving 0009, 
Explicitly placing an image object as the background of a drawing works as
expected.  However when the drawing is 'flattend' the above mentioned trials
appear. I changed how drawing treats background images. Instead of having
a dedicated field for backgrounds the background image is now treated as
any other drawing element in the root group.  This eliminated the trailing
bug but flatten still does not work, which leads to a new bug re[port 0010

BUG 0010 2015.02.04 sgwr drawing flatten not implemented.
