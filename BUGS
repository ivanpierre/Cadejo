# ---------------------------------------------------------- BUG 0001 CLOSED
BUG 0001 2014.02.14 STATUS CLOSED
MASA does not always produce tones when used in a monophonic layer

(def s (cadejo.midi.scene/scene ...))
(def algo-0 (cadejo.instruments.algo.engine/algo-mono s 0))
(def masa-0 (cadejo.instruments.masa.engine/masa-mono s 0))

The order in which the two instruments are created appears to make a
difference. If MASA is created first it is more likely to work then if it
is created second.

Solution: This had nothing to do with MASA per se. Not too sure what the
real cause was but it appears that perhaps Overtone was requesting the SC
server to compile synths faster then it could keep up. The compilation
proceeded without any errors or warnings yet the synths were in some manner
"broken" and non-functional. The solution is to insert a short delay via
Thread/sleep after a number of synth objects are created. By trial a value
of 100 ms seams to be be adequate. The most logical location for these
delays is either inside the voice creation loop for poly-phonic instruments
or as the penultimate statement of mono-phonic instrument.

BUG 0002 2014.02.14 STATUS CLOSED
Performance using mono-keymode with transposition broken.

When a performance using mono-keymode has a non-zero :transpose property
the note-off event does not transpose the note number. As a result on a
key-up the instruments pitch abruptly shifts from the transposed to the non
transposed frequencies.

Made modification to cadejo.midi.mono-keymode
