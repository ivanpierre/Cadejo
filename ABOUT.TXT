Cadejo is a comprehensive framework for MIDI control of Overtone
instruments.  A breif overview of it's cababilities are:

* Layring - An arbitary number of instruments may resopind to any given
  MIDI channel.

* Multi timbral - Each MIDI channel may respond with any number of
  instruments. 

* Key Splits. Each instrument may respond to a slected range of keys. 

* Alternate tuning. Tuning tables are implemented on a per instrument
  basis. 

* Alternate key modes. Currently two keyboard responces are implemented:
  mono and poly. Poly mode uses a fixed numner of voices with voice
  stealing. 

* Full suport for pitch-bend, channel-pressure, MIDI control change and
  program changes
